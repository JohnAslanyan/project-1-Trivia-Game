# Unsolved Problems

In the development of this project, I encountered several challenges that remain unresolved. Addressing these would significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of my application. 
## 1. Adding a Skip Button
**Problem:** Implementing a feature that allows users to skip the current question and move on to the next one. This functionality is crucial for maintaining user engagement, especially when they are stuck on a particular question.

## 2. Adding a Hint Function
**Problem:** Developing a system to provide hints to users. This feature should give clues about the answer without revealing it directly, aiding the learning process and keeping the game challenging. 

## 3. Ability to Eliminate Answers
**Problem:** Creating a feature that allows users to eliminate one or more incorrect answers from the choices. This '50/50' like feature could help in narrowing down the possibilities and make the game more interactive and strategic.

## 4. Generating New Questions
**Problem:** Implementing a function to generate new questions. This is essential to keep the content fresh and engaging for repeat users.
